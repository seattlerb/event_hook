= event_hook

* http://rubyforge.org/projects/seattlerb

== DESCRIPTION:

NOTE: This project is EOL'd since it relies on MRI 1.8 internals.

Wraps rb_add_event_hook so you can write fast ruby event hook
processors w/o the speed penalty that comes with set_trace_func (sooo
sloooow!). Calls back into ruby so you don't have to write C.

    % ruby demo.rb 
    # of iterations = 1000000
                              user     system      total        real
    null_time             0.120000   0.000000   0.120000 (  0.125279)
    ruby time             0.560000   0.000000   0.560000 (  0.562834)
    event hook            3.160000   0.010000   3.170000 (  3.175361)
    set_trace_func       34.530000   0.100000  34.630000 ( 34.942785)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Simple subclass design. Override ::process and you're off.
* Filters on calls/returns to not bog down on extraneous events.
* Not sure why process needs to be a class method. Will fix eventually.

== SYNOPSIS:

  class StupidTracer < EventHook
    self.process(*args)
      p args
    end
  end

== REQUIREMENTS:

* RubyInline

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install event_hook
